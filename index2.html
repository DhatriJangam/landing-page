            <h2>Nature</h2>
            <p>Nature provides us with many resources, and we return its kindness by overexploiting and harming nature. Thus, as people living on Earth, we need to be conscious of our actions on surroundings that disrupt its natural flow. Human activities are the main villain that harms nature.

    <h2><a class="History"></a></h2>
    <p>Nature’s archive comprises all the content published since the journal’s launch in 1869;  it includes some images, articles and language that by twenty-first-century standards are offensive and harmful, including sexist, racist and other discriminatory content. This content does not represent Nature’s current values and would be unacceptable to publish today. We have not sought to suppress it because it is part of the scientific and historical record, and so should remain available for scholars now and in the future. Nature is committed to making the changes necessary to ensure that it learns from its past and creates a publication that champions science for everyone.

    <p>The first issue of Nature was published on 4 November 1869. Many earlier publishing adventures in science had failed dismally, but Nature’s eventual success grew out of the social and scientific conditions under which it was founded — driven by the vision of strong personalities, who forged ahead when the odds seemed against them. Nature, above all, has been a survivor. This it owes to Alexander Macmillan, who tolerated a loss-making venture for three decades; to Norman Lockyer, the first editor; and to a string of influential collaborators and contributors, including biologist Thomas Henry Huxley — one of the heavyweights of Victorian science and a staunch ally of Charles Darwin (he was known as ‘Darwin’s bulldog’).
